## Projects

### [Noordzij Cube](https://haw-type-design.github.io/noordzij-cube/)
A 3D model of the Noordzij Cube accessible via the browser. See it from all sides, choose letter orientation and which layers you want to see. A tool to help students at HAW Hamburg better understand the Noorzij cube.

The pipeline to produce this cube looked as follows: a variable font with one HOI axis, designed in Glyphs > Blender + ST2 to create the 3D cube, export as .glb >  Babylon.js + HTML to create the interface and 3D environment.
